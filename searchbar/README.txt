A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/sdaitzman/pen/rmqfB.

 A search button which becomes the search bar when clicked on, reducing the need for space and looking great the whole time. Supports virtually all browsers and touch, looks great, and Apple stole it for their recent redesign :P
